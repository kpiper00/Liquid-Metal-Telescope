# Liquid-Metal-Telescope
For the Intel Science Fair in 2019, I worked on developing a Liquid Metal telescope using Gallium, as well as testing various other materials for liquid telescope casting. This repository documents some of the results from this project.

Unfortunately, data relating to this project was lost when my high school email account was deleted after graduation.
