# Liquid-Metal-Telescope
Development of Frozen Liquid Telecopes, using Gallium, Beeswax, and Acryllic
For the Intel Science Fair in 2019, I worked on developing a Liquid Metal telescope using Gallium, as well as testing various other materials for liquid telescope casting. This repository documents some of the results from this project. Three materials were tested, Gallium, Acryllic/Epoxy, and Beeswax. Liquid gallium performed similarly to the liquid mercury telescopes our project was based on. Beeswax and Acryllic had various downsides that resulted in poorer performance than commercially availble telescopes, but showed promising results for a fraction of the cost of commercial telescopes. Manufactruing was done using a CNC machine to make dishes, and pottery wheel was used to generate the centrifugal force which created a parabola. Unfortunately, quantitative data relating to this project was lost when my high school email account was deleted after graduation.
